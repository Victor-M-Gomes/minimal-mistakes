# About me

I am currently a Master student in Geophysics at Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niterói, Brazil. 
Also at this university I received my bachelor in Geophysics (2014). Besides finishing
my dissertation I am involved with processing land seismic data from Volta Redonda basin, in
a project with my advisor.

My short-time goal is to continue on the academia through a PhD position. 

## Relevant Information

  * Experience in the field of digital signal processing and multiresolution analysis
  * Base level knowledge with shell scripting 	in Linux
  * **Programming languages**: FORTRAN, Python and C
  * **Software Knowledge**: Matlab, Petrel (Basic knowledge gained during SPOC), OpendTect, Surfer 11, QGIS, Oasis Montaj - Geosoft, HampsonRussell, Seismic Unix, VISTA - Schlumberger

## Summary of past experiences

  * **Research project/internship**: Stratigraphic, Sedimentological and Geochemical
Characterization of the lagoons: Vermelha and Salgada and the Espinho's marsh (Part
1) – Acquisition and processing of seismic, GPR and GPS data, geologic and
stratigraphic study of coastal environments related to the genesis of the lagoons
Vermelha and Salgada and the Espinho's marsh. (2011 – 2013)
  * **PIBIC research project/internship**: 3D Seismic data Compression using the Wavelet
Transform (Continuation) - Advanced signal processing,
processing and image compression in the wavelet transform domain. Implementation
of MATLAB functions and later implementation of compression algorithms using
FORTRAN 90 language for the compression of seismic signals, 2D and 3D, pre and
post-stack. Study of codification and quantization techniques in order to achieve even
beter compression rates in the wavelet domain, as the SPIHT (Set partitioning in
hierarchical trees). (2012 – 2014)
  * **President of the Geoscientific Student Society (GSS) of UFF, including SEG,
EAGE and AAPG student chapters**: Organization of lectures sponsored by SEG
and courses, exchange of knowledge and experiences among students of geophysics,
encouraging teamwork and helping to organize events and projects at the university.
More recently, organized the third LAGSC (Latin American Geosciences Student
Conference), held between July, 26 and August, 1 of 2015. (2012 – 2015)
  * **Bachelor`s final project**: A study of three algorithms of seismic acoustic inversion (seismic trace inversion) and consequently seismic deconvolution and their sensibilities
to wavelets estimated using a couple of seismic wavelet estimation methods. The study
involved implementing algorithms of seismic inversion, deconvolution and seismic
wavelet estimation and then, to analyze the behavior of the first in relation to the
wavelets estimated.
  * **Master`s project**: Analysis of the Curvelet transform in post-stack seismic data
denoising focusing on conditioning for acoustic inversion. Three methodologies were
compared, the simpler one involving magnitude-wise truncation (hard thresholding) of
coeficients in the Curvelet domain, while the other two considered the spatial context
of neighbor coeficients in a Bayesian rule for thresholding. Moreover, the last two
assigned a Laplacian prior to the coeficients in each Curvelet sub-band of seismic data.
Besides empirically proving the validity of the prior to seismic data, one of the
methodologies is a novelty and showed good performance for both white and bandlimited
(correlated) noise.
