## List of codes

I am currently organizing my codes in order to make them available to the public. They will be sequentially published here, as soon as I am finished preparing them.

<!-- To centralize the picture -->
<style> 
img {
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    width: 50%;
} 
.grayscale {-webkit-filter: grayscale(50%);filter: grayscale(50%);}
</style>

<img class="grayscale" src="/assets/images/under_construction.gif" alt="http://photobucket.com/gallery/user/muklis-photos/media/bWVkaWFJZDo1NzQzMzk3Mw==/?ref=" style="width:256px;height:256px;">
