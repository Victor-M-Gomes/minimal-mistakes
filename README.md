===================

This is my personal/academic website hosted on Github and powered by Jekyll. 
    For help making your own, see [this page](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) which
	I used as a starting point to contruct mine.
    The initial idea of constructing one came from [Victor Thadeu Xavier de Almeida]( https://victortxa.github.io/ ),
    to whom I would like to thank for the help.
